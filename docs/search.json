    "section": "What Is a Recommendation System?",
    "text": "What Is a Recommendation System?\nA recommendation system is a tool designed to predict what content you are most likely to enjoy next. Instead of showing the same videos to everyone, platforms like TikTok and YouTube personalize each feed. Their goal is simple: keep users engaged by showing videos they are likely to watch for longer.\nThink of it like a digital DJ. A DJ watches the crowd and plays songs that keep people dancing. If the crowd responds well, the DJ plays more of that style. Recommendation systems do the same thing, except instead of music, they use videos, and instead of watching a crowd, they watch your interactions.\nThe system does not truly “know” you as a person. Instead, it looks for patterns in your behavior and compares them with patterns from millions of other users."

    "section": "What Data Do TikTok and YouTube Use?",
    "text": "What Data Do TikTok and YouTube Use?\nThe most important data comes from your actions. Every time you interact with a video, you are sending signals to the system.\nOne of the strongest signals is watch time. If you watch a video all the way through, replay it, or pause scrolling to focus on it, the system treats this as a strong sign of interest. On the other hand, quickly skipping a video sends a negative signal. Likes, comments, shares, saves, and follows also matter, but they happen less often than watching, so watch time usually carries more weight.\nThe system also considers context. This includes things like the time of day you are using the app, the language your device is set to, and what type of device you are on. For example, the system might show shorter or lighter content late at night when users tend to scroll casually.\nFinally, the system uses information about the videos themselves. This includes topics, hashtags, captions, audio, and the creator. By analyzing this information, the platform can group similar videos together, even if they are made by different creators."

    "section": "The Basic Recommendation Pipeline",
    "text": "The Basic Recommendation Pipeline\nAlthough the technology behind recommendation systems can be very complex, the basic idea can be explained as a simple loop with four steps.\nFirst, the system builds a user profile. This is a rough summary of what you seem to like based on your recent behavior. It is not a permanent label and can change quickly if your habits change.\nSecond, the system picks candidates. From millions of available videos, it creates a shortlist of content that might interest you. These candidates could include videos similar to ones you watched before, videos popular with users who behave like you, or even new content the platform wants to test.\nThird, the system ranks these candidates. It orders the videos based on how likely you are to watch each one. The top-ranked videos are what you see on your feed.\nFinally, the system learns from feedback. Your next action—whether you watch, skip, like, or scroll—updates your profile. This updated profile then affects the next batch of videos you see, and the cycle repeats.\nThis entire process happens extremely fast, often updating within seconds."

    "text": "Why the Feed Feels “Scary Accurate” or Repetitive\nMany users describe recommendation systems as “creepy” because they seem to know exactly what they want. This happens because the feedback loop updates so quickly. Even watching a few videos on the same topic can significantly influence what the system shows you next.\nAt the same time, this loop can cause feeds to feel repetitive. If you consistently watch one type of content—such as cooking videos or study tips—the system keeps receiving strong positive signals for that topic. As a result, it shows you more of the same, sometimes at the expense of variety.\nThis is not necessarily intentional manipulation. The system is simply doing what it was designed to do: maximize the chance that you will keep watching."

    "text": "Simple Tips to Control Your Feed\nAlthough you cannot fully control recommendation systems, you can influence them more than you might think.\nIf you want more variety, try actively searching for new topics or following different creators. Skipping videos quickly can also signal disinterest. On many platforms, using features like “Not interested” or “Hide this video” sends a clear negative signal.\nBeing mindful of watch time is especially important. Even if you dislike a video, watching it all the way through can tell the system that it held your attention. Small habits, repeated over time, shape your feed more than single actions."

    "text": "Conclusion\nTikTok and YouTube feeds are not random, and they are not magical. They are the result of a continuous cycle of prediction, ranking, and learning. The system guesses what you might like, shows it to you, and then adjusts based on how you respond.\nThe key takeaway is simple: every scroll is a signal. Your actions train the system, and the system responds by shaping what you see next. Understanding this process can help you better navigate your feed—and maybe even take back a bit of control over it."
